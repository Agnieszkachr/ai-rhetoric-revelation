        "The passage begins with an introduction to the revelation and a blessing ('μακάριος ὁ ἀναγινώσκων'), which is prophetic exhortation.

The description of the glorified Christ, with eyes like fire and a sword coming from his mouth, evokes Theophanic Awe & Terror (25.0). The declaration 'I am the first and the last' and 'I have the keys of death and Hades' suggests Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope (10.0). The mention of 'tribulation' and the 'word of God' suggests Lament, Persecution & Endurance (10.0). The description of Christ's power and authority hints at Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action (5.0).

        "This passage consists of letters to seven churches. 'Worship & Praise' is present but minimal (3.0%) as the focus is not direct worship but rather Christ's assessment of their actions. 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' is significant (18.0%) due to threats of judgment against those who are unfaithful (e.g., 'κινήσω τὴν λυχνίαν σου', 'βάλλω αὐτὴν εἰς κλίνην', 'ἀποκτενῶ ἐν θανάτῳ', 'μέλλω σε ἐμέσαι'). 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' (8.0%) is evident in the descriptions of suffering and trials faced by some churches ('Οἶδά σου τὴν θλῖψιν καὶ τὴν πτωχείαν', 'ἕξετε θλῖψιν'). 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (15.0%) appears in promises to the overcomers (νικῶντι), such as eating from the tree of life ('δώσω αὐτῷ φαγεῖν ἐκ τοῦ ξύλου τῆς ζωῆς'), receiving a crown of life ('δώσω σοι τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς'), and becoming a pillar in God's temple ('ποιήσω αὐτὸν στῦλον ἐν τῷ ναῷ τοῦ θεοῦ μου'). 'Cosmic Warfare & Deception' (12.0%) is present in references to Satan's throne ('ὅπου ὁ θρόνος τοῦ Σατανᾶ'), the synagogue of Satan ('συναγωγῆς τοῦ Σατανᾶ'), and Jezebel's deception ('πλανᾷ τοὺς ἐμοὺς δούλους'). 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' (30.0%) is dominant, with repeated calls to repent ('μετανόησον'), warnings against false teachings ('ἔχω κατὰ σοῦ ὅτι ἀφεῖς τὴν γυναῖκα Ἰεζάβελ'), and commands to listen ('ὁ ἔχων οὖς ἀκουσάτω'). 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' (4.0%) is suggested by descriptions of Christ's appearance ('ὁ ἔχων τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ ὡς φλόγα πυρός'), but it is not a primary focus. 'Other/Neutral Content' (10.0%) includes introductory phrases and descriptive elements that do not strongly align with the other categories.",

        "The passage primarily describes the New Jerusalem, emphasizing its beauty and glory. 'ἔχουσαν τὴν δόξαν τοῦ θεοῦ' and descriptions of precious stones contribute to the 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (35%) and 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' (8%) categories. The statement 'καὶ οἱ δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ λατρεύσουσιν αὐτῷ' and 'κύριος ὁ θεὸς φωτίσει ἐπʼ αὐτούς, καὶ βασιλεύσουσιν εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων' clearly indicates 'Worship & Praise' (15%). 'καὶ οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς αὐτὴν πᾶν κοινὸν καὶ ποιῶν βδέλυγμα καὶ ψεῦδος' is a 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' (5%). The detailed descriptions of the city's dimensions, materials, and layout, such as 'καὶ ἡ πόλις τετράγωνος κεῖται' and the list of foundation stones, fall under 'Other/Neutral Content' (35%) as they are primarily descriptive and do not strongly align with the other categories. 'καὶ πᾶν κατάθεμα οὐκ ἔσται ἔτι' suggests a removal of judgment, thus 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' is at 2%."
