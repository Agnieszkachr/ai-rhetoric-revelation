        "The passage opens with a strong emphasis on 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' (20%) through the declaration of the text as 'Apocalypse' and 'prophecy' (1:1, 1:3), culminating in the beatitude and command to 'keep what is written' (1:3). 'Worship & Praise' (25%) is prominent in the explicit doxology to Christ ('αὐτῷ ἡ δόξα καὶ τὸ κράτος εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων · ἀμήν' - 1:6) and the worshipful descriptions of God and Christ (e.g., 'ὁ μάρτυς ὁ πιστός, ὁ πρωτότοκος τῶν νεκρῶν καὶ ὁ ἄρχων τῶν βασιλέων τῆς γῆς' - 1:5a; 'ὁ παντοκράτωρ' - 1:8). 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (15%) is evident in Christ's act of freeing humanity from sins and making them 'a kingdom, priests' (1:5b-6), and his titles as 'firstborn of the dead' and 'ruler of the kings of the earth' (1:5a). 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' (20%) is conveyed by the repeated divine self-designation 'ὁ ὢν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος' (1:4, 1:8) and the powerful vision of Christ 'coming with the clouds' (1:7), which inspires awe. This manifestation also leads to 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' (15%), as 'all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him' ('κόψονται ἐπʼ αὐτὸν πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς' - 1:7), signifying judgment. 'Other/Neutral Content' (5%) accounts for the initial framing and salutation (1:1-2, 1:4a).

        "The passage is dominated by **Prophetic Exhortation & Warning** (38.0%), as Christ directly addresses each of the seven churches, offering commendations ('Οἶδα τὰ ἔργα σου'), rebukes ('ἔχω κατὰ σοῦ'), calls to repentance ('μετανόησον'), and specific instructions ('γίνου γρηγορῶν', 'κρατήσατε', 'συμβουλεύω σοι'). **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope** (28.0%) is a strong secondary theme, consistently appearing in the promises to 'the one who conquers' (τῷ νικῶντι), which include eschatological blessings like the tree of life, hidden manna, white robes, a new name, and shared reign in the New Jerusalem. **Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action** (15.0%) is evident in explicit warnings of judgment for unrepentance, such as the removal of a lampstand ('κινήσω τὴν λυχνίαν σου'), Christ fighting with the sword of his mouth ('πολεμήσω μετʼ αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ ῥομφαίᾳ'), Jezebel and her followers facing tribulation and death ('βάλλω αὐτὴν εἰς κλίνην', 'ἀποκτενῶ ἐν θανάτῳ'), Christ coming as a thief ('ἥξω ὡς κλέπτης'), and being 'spit out' ('μέλλω σε ἐμέσαι'). **Lament, Persecution & Endurance** (10.0%) is woven throughout, acknowledging the churches' suffering ('θλῖψιν', 'πτωχείαν'), martyrdom (Antipas), and commending their steadfastness ('ὑπομονήν'). **Cosmic Warfare & Deception** (5.0%) is present through references to false apostles, Nicolaitans, Balaam, Jezebel, the 'synagogue of Satan', 'Satan's throne', and 'depths of Satan', highlighting spiritual adversaries and deceptive teachings. **Theophanic Awe & Terror** (4.0%) is conveyed by Christ's majestic self-descriptions at the beginning of each letter, emphasizing his divine authority and awe-inspiring attributes (e.g., 'fiery eyes', 'bronze feet', 'sharp two-edged sword', 'the First and the Last'). **Worship & Praise** (0.0%) is not a direct rhetorical act within this passage, as it primarily consists of Christ's messages to the churches. **Other/Neutral Content** (0.0%) is minimal, as the entire passage is highly thematic and performative, with formulaic elements directly serving the prophetic message.",

        "The passage is overwhelmingly dominated by 'Worship & Praise,' particularly from v.8 onwards, with the 'new song' (ᾠδὴν καινὴν), the repeated declarations of worthiness ('Ἄξιος εἶ', 'Ἄξιόν ἐστιν'), and the universal acclamation of 'blessing, honor, glory, and might' (εὐλογία, τιμὴ, δόξα, κράτος) to the Lamb and the One on the throne, culminating in prostration (προσεκύνησαν). 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' is clearly present in John's profound weeping ('ἔκλαιον πολὺ') in v.4. 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' is central, introduced by the elder's comforting words ('Μὴ κλαῖε') and the declaration that the Lion of Judah 'has conquered' (ἐνίκησεν) in v.5, and further emphasized by the Lamb's worthiness through sacrifice ('ἐσφάγης') and the ransoming of people to be a 'kingdom and priests' (βασιλείαν καὶ ἱερεῖς). 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is evoked by the initial vision of the One on the throne and the sealed scroll (v.1), the powerful angel's proclamation (v.2), and especially the striking image of the Lamb 'standing as though slain' (ἀρνίον ἑστηκὸς ὡς ἐσφαγμένον) with seven horns and eyes (v.6). 'Other/Neutral Content' accounts for the initial descriptive narrative setting the scene (v.1-3) before the core theological and emotional themes fully unfold.

'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (35%) is central, highlighted by the elder's 'Do not weep' (Μὴ κλαῖε) and the declaration that the Lion of Judah 'has conquered' (ἐνίκησεν) (v. 5). The Lamb 'as though slain' (ὡς ἐσφαγμένον) (v. 6) signifies victory through sacrifice, enabling him to take the scroll and establish a 'kingdom and priests' who 'will reign on the earth' (βασιλεύουσιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς) (v. 10). John's 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' (5%) is evident in his 'wept much' (ἔκλαιον πολὺ) (v. 4) over the scroll's inaccessibility. 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' (10%) is evoked by the vision of the One on the throne (v. 1), the unique description of the Lamb (v. 6), and the overwhelming number of angels (myriads of myriads) (v. 11).

'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is powerfully depicted in the sixth seal's cosmic upheaval (σεισμὸς μέγας, sun black, moon blood, stars falling) and the universal fear of 'Him who sits on the throne' (τοῦ καθημένου ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου) (vv. 12-17). 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' is central to the fifth seal, where the souls of martyrs cry out 'How long, O Lord?' (Ἕως πότε, ὁ δεσπότης) for justice (vv. 9-11). 'Cosmic Warfare & Deception' is evident in the agents of the seals (Death, Hades) and the white horse rider 'conquering and to conquer' (νικῶν καὶ ἵνα νικήσῃ), initiating a series of conflicts (vv. 2, 4, 8).

'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is powerfully conveyed in the sixth seal (6:12-17) with the cosmic disturbances (earthquake, sun, moon, stars, sky) and the universal fear of humanity hiding from 'the face of him who is seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb' (ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ καθημένου ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ὀργῆς τοῦ ἀρνίου). 'Cosmic Warfare & Deception' is evident in the unleashing of destructive forces by the first four seals: the white horse 'conquering' (νικῶν καὶ ἵνα νικήσῃ), the red horse bringing war (μάχαιρα μεγάλη), and the pale horse bringing widespread death. 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' is central to the fifth seal (6:9-11), depicting the souls of the martyred (ἐσφαγμένων) crying out 'How long, O Lord?' (Ἕως πότε) and being told to endure a little longer (ἀναπαύσονται ἔτι χρόνον μικρόν).

        "The passage is dominated by the unfolding of divine judgment and its terrifying effects. 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' is prominent through the consequences of the second (taking peace, mutual slaughter), third (famine), and fourth (death by sword, famine, plague, beasts) seals, culminating in the explicit mention of 'the great day of their wrath' (ἡ ἡμέρα ἡ μεγάλη τῆς ὀργῆς αὐτῶν) in 6:17. 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is powerfully conveyed in the sixth seal (6:12-17) with the cosmic disturbances (earthquake, sun, moon, stars, sky) and the universal fear of humanity hiding from 'the face of him who is seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb' (ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ καθημένου ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ὀργῆς τοῦ ἀρνίου). 'Cosmic Warfare & Deception' is evident in the unleashing of destructive forces by the first four seals: the white horse 'conquering' (νικῶν καὶ ἵνα νικήσῃ), the red horse bringing war (μάχαιρα μεγάλη), and the pale horse bringing widespread death. 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' is central to the fifth seal (6:9-11), depicting the souls of the martyred (ἐσφαγμένων) crying out 'How long, O Lord?' (Ἕως πότε) and being told to endure a little longer (ἀναπαύσονται ἔτι χρόνον μικρόν). 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' is present in the white robes (στολὴ λευκή) given to the martyrs (6:11), symbolizing their vindication and future triumph. There is no explicit 'Worship & Praise' or 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' directed to humanity in this section.",

        "The passage is dominated by 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' (45.0%) through the explicit killing of 'τὸ τρίτον τῶν ἀνθρώπων' (a third of mankind) by 'πληγῶν' (plagues) initiated by divine command ('Λῦσον τοὺς τέσσαρας ἀγγέλους'). 'Cosmic Warfare & Deception' (25.0%) is evident in the description of the supernatural agents of destruction—the 'τέσσαρας ἀγγέλους τοὺς δεδεμένους' (four bound angels), the 'δισμυριάδες μυριάδων' (two myriads of myriads) cavalry with monstrous features ('κεφαλαὶ λεόντων', 'οὐραὶ ὄφεσιν') emitting 'πῦρ καὶ καπνὸς καὶ θεῖον' (fire and smoke and sulfur), and the unrepentant worship of 'δαιμόνια καὶ τὰ εἴδωλα'. 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' (20.0%) is present in the announcement of 'οὐαὶ' (woe) and the strong denunciation of humanity's unrepentant state ('οὐδὲ μετενόησαν') despite the judgment, listing their sins ('φόνων', 'φαρμάκων', 'πορνείας', 'κλεμμάτων').

This category is reinforced by the 'φόβος μέγας' (11:11) and 'σεισμὸς μέγας' (11:13) later in the text. **Prophetic Exhortation & Warning** is central, as John is commanded to seal the thunders (10:4), eat the scroll and prophesy again ('Δεῖ σε πάλιν προφητεῦσαι', 10:8-11), and measure the temple (11:1). The two witnesses are explicitly described as prophesying ('προφητεύσουσιν', 11:3). **Lament, Persecution & Endurance** is a dominant theme, highlighted by the trampling of the holy city (11:2), the witnesses clothed in sackcloth (11:3), and especially their martyrdom by the Beast ('νικήσει αὐτοὺς καὶ ἀποκτενεῖ αὐτούς', 11:7) and the subsequent rejoicing of their enemies ('χαίρουσιν ἐπʼ αὐτοῖς καὶ εὐφραίνονται', 11:10). **Cosmic Warfare & Deception** is evident in the Beast's direct conflict with the witnesses ('ποιήσει μετʼ αὐτῶν πόλεμον', 11:7). **Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action** is manifested through the witnesses' power to inflict plagues ('πῦρ ἐκπορεύεται', 'στρέφειν αὐτὰ εἰς αἷμα', 'πατάξαι τὴν γῆν ἐν πάσῃ πληγῇ', 11:5-6) and the earthquake that kills 7,000 people ('ἀπεκτάνθησαν ἐν τῷ σεισμῷ', 11:13). **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope** shines through the resurrection and ascension of the witnesses ('πνεῦμα ζωῆς ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ εἰσῆλθεν ἐν αὐτοῖς', 'ἀνέβησαν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν', 11:11-12). Finally, **Worship & Praise** is present in the angel's oath acknowledging God as Creator ('ὤμοσεν τῷ ζῶντι... ὃς ἔκτισεν τὸν οὐρανὸν', 10:6) and the survivors giving glory to God ('ἔδωκαν δόξαν τῷ θεῷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ', 11:13).

The two witnesses are explicitly described as prophesying ('προφητεύσουσιν', 11:3). **Lament, Persecution & Endurance** is a dominant theme, highlighted by the trampling of the holy city (11:2), the witnesses clothed in sackcloth (11:3), and especially their martyrdom by the Beast ('νικήσει αὐτοὺς καὶ ἀποκτενεῖ αὐτούς', 11:7) and the subsequent rejoicing of their enemies ('χαίρουσιν ἐπʼ αὐτοῖς καὶ εὐφραίνονται', 11:10). **Cosmic Warfare & Deception** is evident in the Beast's direct conflict with the witnesses ('ποιήσει μετʼ αὐτῶν πόλεμον', 11:7). **Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action** is manifested through the witnesses' power to inflict plagues ('πῦρ ἐκπορεύεται', 'στρέφειν αὐτὰ εἰς αἷμα', 'πατάξαι τὴν γῆν ἐν πάσῃ πληγῇ', 11:5-6) and the earthquake that kills 7,000 people ('ἀπεκτάνθησαν ἐν τῷ σεισμῷ', 11:13). **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope** shines through the resurrection and ascension of the witnesses ('πνεῦμα ζωῆς ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ εἰσῆλθεν ἐν αὐτοῖς', 'ἀνέβησαν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν', 11:11-12). Finally, **Worship & Praise** is present in the angel's oath acknowledging God as Creator ('ὤμοσεν τῷ ζῶντι... ὃς ἔκτισεν τὸν οὐρανὸν', 10:6) and the survivors giving glory to God ('ἔδωκαν δόξαν τῷ θεῷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ', 11:13).

        "This extensive passage is dominated by **Cosmic Warfare & Deception** (50%). It vividly describes the Dragon (δράκων) and two Beasts (θηρίον) as monstrous adversaries, their blasphemy (βλασφημίας), their deceptive signs (πλανάω), their coercion of humanity to worship them, and their direct conflict (πόλεμος) with God's people (e.g., 12:3-4, 12:7, 12:9, 13:1-8, 13:11-17). **Lament, Persecution & Endurance** (20%) is a significant theme, detailing the suffering of the woman (κράζει ὠδίνουσα καὶ βασανιζομένη, 12:2; ἐδίωξεν τὴν γυναῖκα, 12:13) and the saints (ποιῆσαι πόλεμον μετὰ τῶν ἁγίων καὶ νικῆσαι αὐτούς, 13:7; οὐκ ἠγάπησαν τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτῶν ἄχρι θανάτου, 12:11; ὧδέ ἐστιν ἡ ὑπομονὴ καὶ ἡ πίστις τῶν ἁγίων, 13:10). **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope** (15%) is present through the male child's ascension (ἡρπάσθη τὸ τέκνον αὐτῆς πρὸς τὸν θεὸν, 12:5), the Dragon's expulsion from heaven (ἐβλήθη ὁ δράκων, 12:9), the declaration of God's salvation and kingdom (Ἄρτι ἐγένετο ἡ σωτηρία καὶ ἡ δύναμις καὶ ἡ βασιλεία, 12:10), the saints overcoming (ἐνίκησαν αὐτὸν, 12:11), and divine protection for the woman (ἐδόθησαν τῇ γυναικὶ αἱ δύο πτέρυγες, 12:14; ἐβοήθησεν ἡ γῆ τῇ γυναικί, 12:16). **Prophetic Exhortation & Warning** (8%) includes direct addresses and admonitions, such as the 'woe' to the earth (οὐαὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν, 12:12), the call to hear (Εἴ τις ἔχει οὖς ἀκουσάτω, 13:9), and the instruction to discern the Beast's number (ὧδε ἡ σοφία ἐστίν · ὁ ἔχων νοῦν ψηφισάτω, 13:18). **Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action** (5%) is primarily seen in the expulsion of the Dragon from heaven (ἐβλήθη ὁ δράκων, 12:9), which is a divine judgment, and the warning of woe for the earth (12:12) due to the devil's descent. **Theophanic Awe & Terror** (2%) is minimally present, mainly in the initial description of the 'great sign' (σημεῖον μέγα ὤφθη ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ, 12:1), which sets a tone of cosmic revelation, but the passage quickly shifts to narrative conflict rather than direct divine manifestation causing awe or terror. **Worship & Praise** (0%) is absent in terms of true adoration of God or the Lamb; the only worship described is the false worship directed towards the Dragon and the Beast (προσεκύνησαν τῷ δράκοντι... καὶ τῷ θηρίῳ, 13:4). **Other/Neutral Content** (0%) is not applicable as the entire passage is highly thematic and contributes directly to the theological-rhetorical categories.",

        "This extensive passage is overwhelmingly dominated by **Cosmic Warfare & Deception** (45.0%).

Key elements include the Dragon's attempt to devour the child (καταφάγῃ, 12:4), the Dragon's identity as 'the deceiver of the whole world' (ὁ πλανῶν τὴν οἰκουμένην ὅλην, 12:9), the Beasts' blasphemies (βλασφημίας, 13:1, 5), their deceptive signs (σημεῖα μεγάλα, 13:14), and the imposition of the mark (χάραγμα, 13:16) to enforce false worship (προσεκύνησαν, 13:4, 8). **Lament, Persecution & Endurance** (25.0%) is also highly prominent, reflecting the suffering of the faithful. This includes the woman's pain in childbirth (ὠδίνουσα καὶ βασανιζομένη, 12:2), her flight and persecution by the Dragon (ἔφυγεν, ἐδίωξεν, 12:6, 13), the Beast's war against and conquering of the saints (ποιῆσαι πόλεμον μετὰ τῶν ἁγίων καὶ νικῆσαι αὐτούς, 13:7), and the explicit call for 'the endurance and faith of the saints' (ἡ ὑπομονὴ καὶ ἡ πίστις τῶν ἁγίων, 13:10).

This strong emphasis on their redeemed status and ultimate triumph contributes significantly to 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (55.0%).

'Theophanic Awe & Terror' (15.0%) is present in the description of the voice from heaven as 'like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder' (ὡς φωνὴν ὑδάτων πολλῶν καὶ ὡς φωνὴν βροντῆς μεγάλης, v.2).

        "The passage is dominated by a series of urgent angelic proclamations and a heavenly voice, making 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' (25%) a primary rhetorical mode (e.g., 'Φοβήθητε τὸν θεὸν καὶ δότε αὐτῷ δόξαν,' 'Ἔπεσεν, ἔπεσεν Βαβυλὼν,' 'Εἴ τις προσκυνεῖ τὸ θηρίον,' 'Γράψον'). 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' (25%) is equally prominent, with explicit declarations of judgment ('ὥρα τῆς κρίσεως αὐτοῦ,' 'Ἔπεσεν, ἔπεσεν Βαβυλὼν') and a detailed, severe description of torment for those who worship the Beast ('πίεται ἐκ τοῦ οἴνου τοῦ θυμοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ,' 'βασανισθήσεται ἐν πυρὶ καὶ θείῳ,' 'ὁ καπνὸς τοῦ βασανισμοῦ αὐτῶν εἰς αἰῶνας αἰώνων ἀναβαίνει'). 'Cosmic Warfare & Deception' (20%) is central as the objects of judgment and warning are the adversarial powers ('Βαβυλὼν ἡ μεγάλη,' 'τοῦ θυμοῦ τῆς πορνείας αὐτῆς,' 'τὸ θηρίον καὶ τὴν εἰκόνα αὐτοῦ,' 'χάραγμα'). 'Worship & Praise' (10%) is explicitly commanded by the first angel ('Φοβήθητε τὸν θεὸν καὶ δότε αὐτῷ δόξαν, ... καὶ προσκυνήσατε τῷ ποιήσαντι'). 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' (8%) is directly addressed in the interlude concerning the saints ('Ὧδε ἡ ὑπομονὴ τῶν ἁγίων ἐστίν'). 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (8%) is conveyed by the blessing for the faithful dead ('Μακάριοι οἱ νεκροὶ ... ἵνα ἀναπαήσονται ἐκ τῶν κόπων αὐτῶν'). 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' (4%) is present in the description of God as Creator ('τῷ ποιήσαντι τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ θάλασσαν καὶ πηγὰς ὑδάτων') and the presence of 'ἀγγέλων ἁγίων καὶ ἐνώπιον τοῦ ἀρνίου' during the torment.

'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' is also very strong, as the entire passage consists of direct commands and warnings: 'Fear God and give him glory, and worship' (v. 7), the conditional warning against worshipping the Beast (v. 9-11), and the command 'Write!' (v. 13). 'Cosmic Warfare & Deception' is present through the depiction of Babylon's corrupting influence (v. 8) and the act of worshipping 'the Beast and its image' and receiving its 'mark' (v. 9). 'Worship & Praise' is explicitly commanded by the first angel (v. 7). 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' is directly referenced with 'the endurance of the saints' (v. 12). 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' is found in the beatitude for the faithful dead, promising 'rest from their labors' (v. 13). 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is not a primary focus, as the terror described is a consequence for the wicked rather than a direct narrative experience of divine manifestation.

        "The passage is overwhelmingly dominated by 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' (48.0%), as it details the pouring out of the seven bowls of God's wrath (φιάλας τοῦ θυμοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ, v. 1), resulting in plagues like 'ἕλκος' (sore, v. 2), 'αἷμα' (blood, v. 3-4), scorching heat (καυματίσαι, v. 8), darkness (ἐσκοτωμένη, v. 10), a great earthquake (σεισμὸς μέγας, v. 18), the destruction of cities, and 'χάλαζα μεγάλη' (great hail, v. 21). 'Cosmic Warfare & Deception' (25.0%) is a strong secondary theme, evident in the targeting of those with 'τὸ χάραγμα τοῦ θηρίου' (mark of the beast, v. 2), the attack on the 'θρόνον τοῦ θηρίου' (throne of the beast, v. 10), the drying of the Euphrates to prepare for 'βασιλέων τῶν ἀπὸ ἀνατολῆς ἡλίου' (kings from the rising of the sun, v. 12), and the explicit mention of 'δράκοντος', 'θηρίου', 'ψευδοπροφήτου' and 'πνεύματα δαιμονίων' gathering for 'τὸν πόλεμον τῆς ἡμέρας τῆς μεγάλης τοῦ θεοῦ' at 'Ἁρμαγεδών' (v. 13-16), culminating in the judgment of 'Βαβυλὼν ἡ μεγάλη' (v. 19). 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' (12.0%) is prominent with the seventh bowl, featuring a 'φωνὴ μεγάλη ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ θρόνου' (loud voice from the temple from the throne, v. 17), 'ἀστραπαὶ καὶ φωναὶ καὶ βρονταί' (flashes of lightning and voices and thunders, v. 18), and cosmic upheaval where 'πᾶσα νῆσος ἔφυγεν, καὶ ὄρη οὐχ εὑρέθησαν' (every island fled, and mountains were not found, v. 20). 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' (9.0%) is conveyed through the repeated observation that people 'οὐ μετενόησαν' (did not repent, v. 9, 11, 21) despite the plagues, and the direct exhortation/blessing in v. 15: 'μακάριος ὁ γρηγορῶν καὶ τηρῶν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ' (blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his garments). 'Worship & Praise' (6.0%) is present in the declarations of the angel of the waters (v. 5) and the altar (v. 7), both affirming God's righteousness and justice ('Δίκαιος εἶ', 'ἀληθιναὶ καὶ δίκαιαι αἱ κρίσεις σου'). 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' and 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' are minimal (0.0%), as the focus is on judgment rather than the suffering of the saints or future hope.

'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' (8.0%) is present in the repeated observation that people 'did not repent' (οὐ μετενόησαν, v. 9, 11) and the beatitude/warning about Christ's coming 'as a thief' (ὡς κλέπτης, v. 15).

        "The passage is overwhelmingly dominated by **Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action** (58.0%). This is evident from the repeated declaration 'Ἔπεσεν, ἔπεσεν Βαβυλὼν ἡ μεγάλη' (v. 2), the explicit commands for retribution ('ἀπόδοτε αὐτῇ ὡς καὶ αὐτὴ ἀπέδωκεν, καὶ διπλώσατε τὰ διπλᾶ' v. 6), the detailed description of her plagues ('θάνατος καὶ πένθος καὶ λιμός, καὶ ἐν πυρὶ κατακαυθήσεται' v. 8), and the angel's symbolic act of casting a millstone into the sea, signifying her utter destruction ('Οὕτως ὁρμήματι βληθήσεται Βαβυλὼν ἡ μεγάλη πόλις, καὶ οὐ μὴ εὑρεθῇ ἔτι' v. 21). The repeated emphasis on God's judgment ('ὁ κρίνας αὐτήν' v. 8, 'ἔκρινεν ὁ θεὸς τὸ κρίμα ὑμῶν' v. 20) underscores this theme. **Prophetic Exhortation & Warning** (15.0%) is prominent through the direct command 'Ἐξέλθατε, ὁ λαός μου, ἐξ αὐτῆς' (v. 4) for God's people to separate from Babylon. The repeated 'Οὐαὶ οὐαί' (Woe, woe) pronouncements by the kings, merchants, and sailors (v. 10, 16, 19) also function as a lament and a warning about the consequences of Babylon's fall. **Cosmic Warfare & Deception** (12.0%) is evident in the characterization of Babylon as a 'κατοικητήριον δαιμονίων καὶ φυλακὴ παντὸς πνεύματος ἀκαθάρτου' (v. 2), linking her to demonic powers. Her 'πορνείας' (fornication) and 'φαρμακείᾳ' (sorcery/magic) by which 'ἐπλανήθησαν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη' (all nations were deceived, v. 23) highlight her role as an agent of spiritual corruption and deception. The 'αἷμα προφητῶν καὶ ἁγίων' (blood of prophets and saints, v. 24) found in her further solidifies her position as an adversary in the cosmic conflict. **Lament, Persecution & Endurance** (9.0%) is expressed through the extensive lamentations of the kings, merchants, and sea captains over Babylon's destruction ('κλαύσουσιν καὶ κόψονται', 'κλαίουσιν καὶ πενθοῦσιν' in v. 9, 11, 15, 19).

        "The passage opens with strong 'Worship & Praise' (19:6-7: 'Ἁλληλουϊά,' 'ἐβασίλευσεν κύριος, ὁ θεός, ὁ παντοκράτωρ,' 'δώσομεν τὴν δόξαν αὐτῷ') and 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (19:7-8: 'ὁ γάμος τοῦ ἀρνίου,' 'ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ἡτοίμασεν ἑαυτήν,' 'βύσσινον λαμπρὸν καθαρόν'). 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' is present in the command to write and the beatitude (19:9-10: 'Γράψον · Μακάριοι,' 'τῷ θεῷ προσκύνησον'). 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is seen in John's prostration (19:10) and the awe-inspiring description of the Rider (19:11-12: 'ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ φλὸξ πυρός'). The core of the passage shifts to 'Cosmic Warfare & Deception' (19:11-14: 'κρίνει καὶ πολεμεῖ,' 'τὰ στρατεύματα τὰ ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ,' 19:19: 'τὸ θηρίον καὶ τοὺς βασιλεῖς...συνηγμένα ποιῆσαι τὸν πόλεμον') and predominantly 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' (19:15: 'πατάξῃ τὰ ἔθνη,' 'ῥάβδῳ σιδηρᾷ,' 'πατεῖ τὴν ληνὸν τοῦ οἴνου τοῦ θυμοῦ τῆς ὀργῆς,' 19:17-18: 'δεῖπνον τὸ μέγα τοῦ θεοῦ' for carrion birds, 19:20-21: 'ἐβλήθησαν οἱ δύο εἰς τὴν λίμνην τοῦ πυρὸς,' 'οἱ λοιποὶ ἀπεκτάνθησαν ἐν τῇ ῥομφαίᾳ'). The ultimate triumph of the Rider as 'Βασιλεὺς βασιλέων καὶ κύριος κυρίων' (19:16) reinforces both 'Worship & Praise' and 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope'. There is no 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' or significant 'Other/Neutral Content' in this section.",
        "The passage begins with strong 'Worship & Praise' (15%) through 'Ἁλληλουϊά' and calls to 'δώσομεν τὴν δόξαν αὐτῷ' (19:6-7), and the angel's command 'τῷ θεῷ προσκύνησον' (19:10), culminating in the title 'Βασιλεὺς βασιλέων καὶ κύριος κυρίων' (19:16). 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (20%) is evident in the 'γάμος τοῦ ἀρνίου' (19:7), the bride's 'βύσσινον λαμπρὸν καθαρόν' (19:8), the beatitude 'Μακάριοι οἱ εἰς τὸ δεῖπνον τοῦ γάμου τοῦ ἀρνίου κεκλημένοι' (19:9), the white-robed armies (19:14), and the ultimate capture of the Beast and False Prophet (19:20). 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' (10%) is present with the command 'Γράψον' (19:9), the affirmation 'Οὗτοι οἱ λόγοι ἀληθινοὶ τοῦ θεοῦ εἰσιν' (19:9), and the instruction to 'τῷ θεῷ προσκύνησον' (19:10) linked to 'τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς προφητείας'.

        "The passage is heavily dominated by the ongoing conflict and its resolution. 'Cosmic Warfare & Deception' is prominent with the binding of 'the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan' (ὁ δράκοντα, ὁ ὄφις ὁ ἀρχαῖος, ὅς ἐστιν Διάβολος καὶ ὁ Σατανᾶς) to prevent him from deceiving the nations (ἵνα μὴ πλανήσῃ ἔτι τὰ ἔθνη), and his later release to 'deceive the nations' (πλανῆσαι τὰ ἔθνη) and gather them for war (συναγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν πόλεμον). 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' is evident in Satan's binding in the abyss (ἔβαλεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν ἄβυσσον), the consumption of Gog and Magog by 'fire from heaven' (πῦρ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ κατέφαγεν αὐτούς), and the ultimate torment of the Devil, Beast, and False Prophet in the 'lake of fire and sulfur' (εἰς τὴν λίμνην τοῦ πυρὸς καὶ θείου, καὶ βασανισθήσονται). 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' is strongly represented by the martyrs who 'lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years' (ἔζησαν καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν μετὰ τοῦ χριστοῦ χίλια ἔτη), are part of the 'first resurrection' (ἡ ἀνάστασις ἡ πρώτη), are 'blessed and holy' (μακάριος καὶ ἅγιος), and over whom 'the second death has no authority' (ὁ δεύτερος θάνατος οὐκ ἔχει ἐξουσίαν). 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' provides the context for the martyrs' reward, specifically mentioning 'the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus' (τὰς ψυχὰς τῶν πεπελεκισμένων διὰ τὴν μαρτυρίαν Ἰησοῦ) and their refusal to worship the beast. 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is present in the angel descending from heaven (ἄγγελον καταβαίνοντα ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ) and fire coming down from heaven, though the focus is on their function rather than the awe they inspire.

        "The passage is dominated by the theme of final judgment. 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is prominent in verse 11 with the description of the 'great white throne' and the one seated upon it, from whose 'face the earth and heaven fled' (οὗ ἀπὸ τοῦ προσώπου ἔφυγεν ἡ γῆ καὶ ὁ οὐρανός), evoking overwhelming divine presence. The core of the passage (vv. 12-15) is 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action,' explicitly stating that 'the dead were judged... according to their deeds' (ἐκρίθησαν οἱ νεκροὶ... κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν) and that 'death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire' (ὁ θάνατος καὶ ὁ ᾅδης ἐβλήθησαν εἰς τὴν λίμνην τοῦ πυρός), culminating in the condemnation of anyone 'not found written in the book of life' (εἴ τις οὐχ εὑρέθη ἐν τῇ βίβλῳ τῆς ζωῆς γεγραμμένος). 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' is subtly present through the mention of the 'book of life' (βίβλῳ τῆς ζωῆς), implying salvation for those whose names are written there, and the ultimate destruction of Death and Hades, signifying a triumph over these final enemies.",
        "The passage is overwhelmingly dominated by themes of divine judgment. The repeated use of 'ἐκρίθησαν' (judged) and the phrase 'κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν' (according to their deeds) explicitly defines the scene as a final judgment. The ultimate punitive action is the casting of the unrighteous, along with 'ὁ θάνατος καὶ ὁ ᾅδης' (Death and Hades), 'εἰς τὴν λίμνην τοῦ πυρός' (into the lake of fire), which is explicitly called 'ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερός' (the second death). This accounts for the high 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' score. The opening verse, describing the 'θρόνον μέγαν λευκὸν' (great white throne) and the one 'οὗ ἀπὸ τοῦ προσώπου ἔφυγεν ἡ γῆ καὶ ὁ οὐρανός' (from whose face the earth and heaven fled away), powerfully evokes 'Theophanic Awe & Terror'. While the primary focus is on judgment, the casting of Death and Hades into the lake of fire, coupled with the mention of the 'βίβλῳ τῆς ζωῆς' (book of life), subtly introduces 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' by signifying the ultimate defeat of death and the implicit salvation of those found in the book of life, paving the way for the new creation.",

'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is present through the direct manifestation of God's presence and light ('ὁ θρόνος τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τοῦ ἀρνίου', 'ὄψονται τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ', 'κύριος ὁ θεὸς φωτίσει ἐπʼ αὐτούς'), evoking fascination and awe rather than terror."

The repeated declaration 'ἰδοὺ ἔρχομαι ταχύ' also functions as a call to readiness. **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope** (25.0%) is prominent through the promise of Christ's swift return for the faithful, the reward for the righteous ('ὁ μισθός μου μετʼ ἐμοῦ'), the assurance of access to the tree of life and the New Jerusalem ('ξύλον τῆς ζωῆς καὶ τοῖς πυλῶσιν εἰσέλθωσιν εἰς τὴν πόλιν'), the offer of 'ὕδωρ ζωῆς δωρεάν', and the final invocation 'ἔρχου, κύριε Ἰησοῦ' and benediction 'Ἡ χάρις τοῦ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ μετὰ πάντων'. **Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action** (15.0%) is clearly depicted in the statement of recompense ('ἀποδοῦναι ἑκάστῳ ὡς τὸ ἔργον ἐστὶν αὐτοῦ'), the exclusion of the wicked from the city ('ἔξω οἱ κύνες καὶ οἱ φάρμακοι...'), and the explicit threats of plagues and removal from salvation for those who tamper with the prophetic words ('ἐπιθήσει ὁ θεὸς ἐπʼ αὐτὸν τὰς πληγὰς', 'ἀφελεῖ ὁ θεὸς τὸ μέρος αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ ξύλου τῆς ζωῆς καὶ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως τῆς ἁγίας'). **Worship & Praise** (8.0%) is present in the angel's command to John ('τῷ θεῷ προσκύνησον'), the implicit adoration in the divine self-declarations of Jesus ('ἐγὼ τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ Ὦ', 'ἡ ῥίζα καὶ τὸ γένος Δαυίδ, ὁ ἀστὴρ ὁ λαμπρός, ὁ πρωϊνός'), and the final invocation 'Ἀμήν · ἔρχου, κύριε Ἰησοῦ'. **Theophanic Awe & Terror** (4.0%) is conveyed by John's prostration before the angel (though corrected) and the majestic, authoritative self-identifications of Christ. **Other/Neutral Content** (3.0%) includes narrative framing elements such as the affirmation of the prophecy's reliability ('Οὗτοι οἱ λόγοι πιστοὶ καὶ ἀληθινοί'), John's role as witness, and the angel's self-identification as a fellow servant. **Lament, Persecution & Endurance** (0.0%) and **Cosmic Warfare & Deception** (0.0%) are not prominent themes in this specific concluding passage.",
