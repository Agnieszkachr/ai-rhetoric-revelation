        "The passage is dominated by Worship & Praise (35.0%), evident in the formal doxology (v. 5b-6) and the accumulation of sovereign titles for God and Christ ('Alpha and the Omega,' 'the Almighty,' 'ruler of the kings of the earth'). Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope (20.0%) is also strong, conveyed through Christ's victorious titles ('firstborn of the dead') and soteriological claims ('freed us from our sins by his blood'). Prophetic Exhortation & Warning (15.0%) is established through the opening beatitude ('Blessed is the one who reads...') and the urgent declaration 'the time is near.' Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action (15.0%) is present in the description of the parousia, where 'all the tribes of the earth will wail' at the sight of the one they 'pierced.' Theophanic Awe & Terror (10.0%) is evoked by the majestic self-declaration of God ('I am the Alpha and the Omega') and the vision of Christ 'coming with the clouds.' A minor score is given to Lament, Persecution & Endurance (5.0%) due to the implicit reference to martyrdom ('those who pierced him') and the need to 'keep' the words in a time of trial. The introductory framing (vv. 1-2) is fully integrated into the prophetic and doxological aims, making the Other/Neutral category unnecessary.",
        "This passage functions as an overture, introducing multiple key themes. The highest scores are given to **Worship & Praise** and **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope**. Worship is prominent in the explicit doxology (vv. 5b-6: 'to him be glory and dominion') and the exalted titles for God and Christ ('the Almighty,' 'ruler of the kings of the earth'). Victory & Consolation are equally strong, conveyed through the beatitude (v. 3), the greeting of 'grace and peace' (v. 4), and the description of believers as 'freed from our sins' and made a 'kingdom, priests' (vv. 5-6). **Judicial Wrath**, **Prophetic Exhortation**, and **Theophanic Awe** are each present but less dominant. Wrath is seen in the prediction that 'all the tribes of the earth will wail' (v. 7). Exhortation appears in the blessing for those who 'hear and who keep what is written' (v. 3). Awe & Terror are evoked by the divine self-declaration 'I am the Alpha and the Omega' (v. 8) and the vision of Christ 'coming with the clouds' (v. 7). **Lament & Endurance** is a minor theme, hinted at by Christ's title 'the faithful witness' (v. 5). The introductory framing (vv. 1-2) is fully integrated into the prophetic purpose, leaving no need for the 'Other/Neutral' category.",

Theophanic Awe & Terror (5.0%) is present in the introductory descriptions of Christ ('eyes like a flame of fire,' 'sharp two-edged sword'), which establish his authority. Worship & Praise (2.0%) is minimal, and Other/Neutral Content (0.0%) is absent as the text is thoroughly rhetorical.",
        "The dominant category is Prophetic Exhortation & Warning (35.0%), as the entire passage consists of seven direct addresses structured by commands ('Write!', 'Repent!', 'Hold fast!'), rebukes ('I have this against you'), and the recurring call to 'listen to what the Spirit is saying.' The second largest category is Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope (20.0%), driven by the powerful promise made to 'everyone who conquers' at the end of each letter (e.g., 'tree of life,' 'crown of life,' 'sit with me on my throne'). Lament, Persecution & Endurance (15.0%) is significant, as Christ repeatedly affirms 'I know your works,' acknowledging their 'toil,' 'affliction,' 'poverty,' and martyrdom ('Antipas my witness'). Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action (12.0%) is prominent through sharp threats like 'I will...remove your lampstand' (2:5), 'make war against them with the sword of my mouth' (2:16), and 'spit you out of my mouth' (3:16).

Lament, Persecution & Endurance (17.0%) is a major theme, acknowledging the 'affliction,' 'poverty,' 'patient endurance,' and martyrdom ('Antipas my witness') of the churches.

        "The chapter's rhetoric is dominated by two interwoven themes. First, **Theophanic Awe & Terror** (35.0%) is established through the overwhelming sensory description of the heavenly throne room: the one who 'looks like jasper and carnelian,' the 'flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder,' the 'sea of glass,' and the four bizarre 'living creatures.' This awe-inspiring setting serves as the stage for the chapter's primary rhetorical purpose: **Worship & Praise** (50.0%). This is explicitly performed through the unceasing song of the creatures ('Holy, holy, holy'), their giving of 'glory and honor and thanks,' and the prostration and doxology of the elders ('You are worthy, our Lord and God'). A minor but significant element of **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope** (10.0%) is present in the depiction of the elders with 'white robes' and 'golden crowns,' symbols of their vindicated status. The scene is initiated by a brief **Prophetic Exhortation & Warning** (5.0%) with the command, 'Come up here.' The remaining categories are absent.",
        "The chapter's rhetorical weight is overwhelmingly divided between two categories. 'Worship & Praise' (55.0%) constitutes the climax and primary activity of the scene, detailed in verses 8-11 with the ceaseless song of the living creatures ('Holy, holy, holy') and the responsive adoration of the elders, who fall down, cast their crowns, and sing, 'You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power.' 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' (35.0%) is the second major component, establishing the scene's overwhelming majesty through descriptions of the throne, the one seated on it ('like jasper and carnelian'), the surrounding phenomena ('flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder'), the sea of glass, and the mysterious four living creatures. Minor scores are assigned to 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' (5.0%) for the initial command, 'Come up here, and I will show you,' and to 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (5.0%) for the imagery of the elders in 'white robes, with golden crowns,' which hints at the reward of the faithful.

        "The chapter's primary rhetorical force is the depiction of divine judgment. 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' (40.0%) is dominant, enacted by the four horsemen who bring conquest, war, famine, and death (v. 2-8) and culminating in the explicit 'wrath of the Lamb' (v. 16-17). This wrath manifests as 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' (20.0%) in the sixth seal, with its cosmic collapse ('great earthquake,' 'sun became black,' v. 12-14) causing humanity to cry for the mountains to hide them. A significant counter-narrative is 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' (15.0%), focused entirely on the fifth seal where martyrs cry, 'how long will it be before you judge and avenge our blood?' (v. 10). 'Cosmic Warfare' (10.0%) is present in the supernatural riders, especially 'Death, and Hades' (v. 8). 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' (8.0%) structures the chapter through the repeated command 'Come!' and the final warning 'who is able to stand?'. A small but crucial note of 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (5.0%) appears as the martyrs are given white robes and told to rest (v. 11). 'Worship & Praise' (2.0%) is minimal, confined to the martyrs' address, 'Sovereign Lord, holy and true' (v. 10).",
        "The analysis of this chapter, which details the opening of the first six seals, is dominated by two interconnected themes. First, **Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action (40.0%)** is the primary driver of the narrative, as the first four horsemen unleash conquest, war (\"slaughter one another\"), economic collapse (\"A quart of wheat for a day's pay\"), and widespread death.

The second most prominent category is Worship & Praise (25.0), expressed through the explicit doxologies of the great multitude ('Salvation belongs to our God,' v. 10) and the angels ('Amen!

Prophetic Exhortation & Warning (5.0) appears in the command 'Do not damage the earth' (v. 3) and the didactic exchange between the elder and John. The remaining categories are minimal, with Other/Neutral Content (2.0) accounting for the descriptive list of tribes.",
        "The chapter's primary rhetorical purpose is to provide assurance, making 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (45.0%) the dominant category. This is evident in the protective 'seal of the living God,' the triumphant 'great multitude... robed in white, with palm branches,' and the ultimate promises that God 'will wipe away every tear from their eyes.' This victory is expressed through 'Worship & Praise' (25.0%), seen in the multitude's cry 'Salvation belongs to our God' and the full angelic doxology ('Amen! Blessing and glory...'). The context for this triumph is 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' (15.0%), as the saints are identified as 'they who have come out of the great ordeal.' The scene is framed by a temporary pause in 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' (5.0%), where angels with 'power to damage earth and sea' are held back. Minor elements include 'Prophetic Exhortation' (5.0%) in the angel's command ('Do not damage the earth'), 'Theophanic Awe' (3.0%) at the cosmic vision, and 'Other/Neutral Content' (2.0%) for the descriptive list of tribes. 'Cosmic Warfare' imagery is absent.",
        "The analysis heavily favors 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (40.0) as the chapter's primary rhetorical function is to provide assurance. This is evident in the protective 'seal' on the 144,000 and the detailed promises of ultimate comfort for the great multitude ('God will wipe away every tear from their eyes'). 'Worship & Praise' (25.0) is the second major category, driven by the explicit doxologies from the multitude and the angels ('Salvation belongs to our God,' 'Blessing and glory and wisdom...'). 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' (15.0) is crucial context, as the victorious saints are identified as those 'who have come out of the great ordeal.' Minor scores are assigned to 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' (5.0) for the restrained 'power to damage earth and sea,' 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' (5.0) for the angel's command to wait, 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' (5.0) for the cosmic vision of angels holding back the winds, and 'Other/Neutral Content' (5.0) for the descriptive listing of the tribes. 'Cosmic Warfare & Deception' is absent.",

        "The primary rhetorical force is Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action (35%), as the central action is the angel casting a censer of \"fire from the altar\" onto the earth, initiating judgment. This is a direct response to the \"prayers of all the saints,\" making Lament, Persecution & Endurance (20%) a crucial, motivating theme.

This judgment is executed through Cosmic Warfare, as a demonic army of monstrous 'locusts' emerges from the 'bottomless pit' led by their king, 'Abaddon' (the Destroyer). The scene is saturated with Theophanic Awe & Terror, conveyed through the darkening of the sun and air by smoke, the terrifying appearance of the locusts ('teeth like lions' teeth'), and the overwhelming sound of their wings 'like the noise of many chariots.'

        "The analysis assigns the highest weight to **Prophetic Exhortation & Warning** (25%) because the passage is fundamentally about the commissioning and execution of prophecy.

Their ministry is performed in \"sackcloth\" (11:3), they are martyred by the beast (11:7), their bodies are publicly desecrated (11:9), and their enemies \"gloat over them\" (11:10), encapsulating the theme of faithful suffering. **Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action** (15%) and **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope** (15%) are given equal weight as they represent the two sides of the witnesses' story. Their power to \"consume their foes\" with fire and \"strike the earth with every kind of plague\" (11:5-6) demonstrates divine judgment. Conversely, their resurrection, when \"the breath of life from God entered them\" (11:11), and their ascension to heaven (11:12) provide a powerful vision of ultimate victory. **Theophanic Awe & Terror** (10%) is established by the opening vision of the \"mighty angel\" (10:1) and the \"seven thunders\" (10:3), and it culminates in the terror of the onlookers who witness the resurrection (11:11) and the subsequent earthquake (11:13). **Cosmic Warfare & Deception** (5%) is present through the action of \"the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit\" (11:7), and **Worship & Praise** (5%) appears in the angel's oath to the Creator (10:6) and the survivors' reaction to the earthquake (11:13). **Other/Neutral Content** (5%) is minimal, reflecting the passage's high rhetorical density.",

        "The passage is dominated by a heavenly celebration of God's enthronement. 'Worship & Praise' is prominent, with the twenty-four elders falling on their faces to worship and singing, 'We give you thanks, Lord God Almighty' (vv. 16-17). This is matched by 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope,' declared by the 'loud voices in heaven': 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord... and he will reign forever and ever' (v. 15), and the promise of 'rewarding your servants' (v. 18). 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' is equally significant, as the elders' song announces that God's 'wrath has come, and the time for judging the dead... and for destroying those who destroy the earth' (v. 18). 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is concentrated in the climactic final verse, with the opening of the temple and the classic signs of divine presence: 'flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail' (v. 19). A small score is given to 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' for the framing statement, 'The third woe is coming very soon' (v. 14), and to 'Cosmic Warfare' for the mention of the now-subdued 'nations' that 'raged' (v. 18).

A strong secondary theme is Lament, Persecution & Endurance (20.0%), evident in the woman's 'agony of giving birth,' the dragon's pursuit, the beast being 'allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them,' and the explicit 'call for the endurance and faith of the saints.'

Their status as 'redeemed from the earth,' 'first fruits for God and the Lamb,' and 'blameless' are all core expressions of eschatological salvation. Worship & Praise (25.0%) is the second most prominent theme, centered on the 'new song' sung 'before the throne' by the redeemed, accompanied by a sound 'like the sound of harpists playing on their harps.' Theophanic Awe & Terror (10.0%) is present in the description of the heavenly voice, which is 'like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder.' A minor score is given to Lament, Persecution & Endurance (5.0%) because the description of the 144,000 as undefiled, truthful, and redeemed implies a past context of trial and faithful witness that they have overcome. Other/Neutral Content (5.0%) accounts for the narrative framing ('Then I looked') and the descriptive character sketch of the victors.",

Theophanic Awe & Terror is present in the description of the heavenly voice being 'like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder.' A minor score is assigned to Lament, Persecution & Endurance, as the victorious state of the 144,000 (e.g., 'redeemed from humankind,' 'follow the Lamb wherever he goes') implicitly points to the trials they have faithfully endured to reach this point of vindication.",
        "The dominant category is Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope (55.0%), as the passage is a vision of the triumphant 'Lamb, standing on Mount Zion' with the redeemed 'one hundred forty-four thousand.' Their status as 'redeemed from the earth,' 'first fruits for God and the Lamb,' and 'blameless' are all core expressions of eschatological salvation. Worship & Praise (25.0%) is the second most prominent theme, centered on the 'new song' sung 'before the throne' by the redeemed, accompanied by a sound 'like the sound of harpists playing on their harps.' Theophanic Awe & Terror (10.0%) is present in the description of the heavenly voice, which is 'like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder.' A minor score is given to Lament, Persecution & Endurance (5.0%) because the description of the 144,000 as undefiled, truthful, and redeemed implies a past context of trial and faithful witness that they have overcome. Other/Neutral Content (5.0%) accounts for the narrative framing ('Then I looked') and the descriptive character sketch of the victors.",

Worship & Praise is the second most prominent category, centered on the heavenly chorus who 'sing a new song before the throne' to the sound of 'harpists playing on their harps.' Lament, Persecution & Endurance is present implicitly; the description of the redeemed as those who have 'not defiled themselves,' are 'virgins,' and have 'no lie' in their mouth points to the trials they have faithfully endured. Theophanic Awe & Terror is evoked by the description of the heavenly voice being 'like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder.' Finally, a small score is assigned to Cosmic Warfare & Deception as the marking of the 144,000 with the Father's name on their foreheads serves as a direct counter-image to the mark of the beast from the previous chapter.",

Prophetic Exhortation & Warning (25%) is the primary rhetorical mode, framing the entire passage as commands and announcements from angels ('said in a loud voice,' 'crying with a loud voice') and a voice from heaven ('Write this'). Lament, Persecution & Endurance (15%) is explicitly stated in the 'call for the endurance of the saints' and implied in the beatitude for those who 'die in the Lord.' Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope (10%) and Worship & Praise (10%) are present as crucial counterpoints, with the promise of 'rest' for the faithful and the initial command to 'worship him who made heaven and earth.' Cosmic Warfare & Deception (10%) provides the context for the entire scene, with the conflict defined by the choice to worship God versus the 'beast and its image.'

The passage is framed as 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' (15.0%), with angels crying in 'a loud voice' and a heavenly voice commanding John to 'Write this.'

        "This passage functions as a heavenly prelude to the final judgments, creating a complex rhetorical blend. The two dominant categories are 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' and 'Worship & Praise'. Wrath is central, introduced immediately with the 'seven angels with seven plagues' and the 'wrath of God' (v. 1), and culminating in the 'seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God' (v. 7). Equally prominent is the hymn of the victors (vv. 3-4), the 'song of Moses... and the song of the Lamb,' which is pure 'Worship & Praise' ('Great and amazing are your deeds,' 'glorify your name,' 'worship before you'). 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' is also a major theme, embodied by 'those who had conquered the beast' (v. 2) now standing in triumph. 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is significant, marked by the 'portent... great and amazing' (v. 1) and especially the powerful image of the temple being 'filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power' so that 'no one could enter' (v. 8). 'Lament' and 'Cosmic Warfare' are present only as retrospective allusions to the struggle the victors have overcome ('conquered the beast'). 'Other/Neutral Content' accounts for narrative framing and description.",

Interwoven with this is a powerful strain of **Worship & Praise (30.0%)**, primarily located in the lengthy hymn (vv. 3-4) which explicitly celebrates God's \"judgments\" being \"revealed.\" The hymn is sung by \"those who had conquered the beast\" (v. 2), establishing a strong theme of **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope (15.0%)**. The entire vision is saturated with **Theophanic Awe & Terror (15.0%)**, from the \"portent in heaven, great and amazing\" (v. 1) to the temple being filled with \"smoke from the glory of God\" (v. 8), rendering it unapproachable.

Equally prominent is the hymn of the victors (vv. 3-4), the 'song of Moses... and the song of the Lamb,' which is pure 'Worship & Praise' ('Great and amazing are your deeds,' 'glorify your name,' 'worship before you'). 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' is also a major theme, embodied by 'those who had conquered the beast' (v. 2) now standing in triumph. 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is significant, marked by the 'portent... great and amazing' (v. 1) and especially the powerful image of the temple being 'filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power' so that 'no one could enter' (v. 8). 'Lament' and 'Cosmic Warfare' are present only as retrospective allusions to the struggle the victors have overcome ('conquered the beast'). 'Other/Neutral Content' accounts for narrative framing and description.",
        "This passage serves as a prelude to the final judgments, creating a complex rhetorical tapestry. The dominant category is **Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action (35.0%)**, as the scene is framed by the \"seven plagues\" and the \"wrath of God\" (v. 1), culminating in the seven angels receiving \"seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God\" (v. 7). Interwoven with this is a powerful strain of **Worship & Praise (30.0%)**, primarily located in the lengthy hymn (vv. 3-4) which explicitly celebrates God's \"judgments\" being \"revealed.\" The hymn is sung by \"those who had conquered the beast\" (v. 2), establishing a strong theme of **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope (15.0%)**. The entire vision is saturated with **Theophanic Awe & Terror (15.0%)**, from the \"portent in heaven, great and amazing\" (v. 1) to the temple being filled with \"smoke from the glory of God\" (v. 8), rendering it unapproachable. A minor note of **Cosmic Warfare & Deception (5.0%)** is present in the reference to the defeated \"beast and its image\" (v. 2). Lament and Exhortation are absent.",

The dominant category is Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action, as the scene is framed by the introduction of the 'seven angels with seven plagues' and the 'seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God.' Equally significant is Worship & Praise, expressed directly through the 'song of Moses... and the song of the Lamb' (vv. 3-4), which celebrates God's deeds and holiness. Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope is also prominent, embodied by 'those who had conquered the beast' singing their triumphal hymn. The climax introduces strong Theophanic Awe & Terror, as the 'temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God,' rendering it unapproachable. The categories of Lament/Persecution and Cosmic Warfare are given minor scores as they represent the past conflict ('conquered the beast') that the victors have overcome, rather than the immediate focus of the scene."

This punitive action is the central theme. Cosmic Warfare & Deception is significant, particularly in the description of the sixth bowl, where 'foul spirits like frogs' (v. 13) emerge from the dragon, beast, and false prophet to gather kings for battle at 'Harmagedon' (v. 16). Theophanic Awe & Terror is also prominent, especially in the climax of the seventh bowl, which features a 'loud voice...from the throne' (v. 17), a cataclysmic earthquake, and 'huge hailstones' (v. 18, 21). Smaller, yet distinct, rhetorical functions are present: Worship & Praise appears in the doxology affirming God's justice ('your judgments are true and just!', v. 7); Lament, Persecution & Endurance is referenced as the reason for judgment ('they shed the blood of saints and prophets', v. 6); Prophetic Exhortation & Warning is found in the parenthetical beatitude ('Blessed is the one who stays awake', v. 15); and Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope is signaled by the final declaration, 'It is done!'

Cosmic Warfare & Deception (15%) is prominent in the sixth bowl vision, where 'demonic spirits' (v. 14) emerge from the dragon and beast to gather kings for battle at Harmagedon.

        "The analysis of this chapter is dominated by the unveiling of the great adversary and her judgment. **Cosmic Warfare & Deception** receives the highest score (35.0%) as the text is saturated with imagery of the 'great whore' (Babylon) and the 'scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names.' The angel's lengthy explanation decodes this adversarial system: the beast's deceptive nature ('was, and is not'), the heads and horns as corrupt kings, and their ultimate 'war on the Lamb.' **Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action** is the second major theme (25.0%), as the chapter's explicit purpose is to 'show you the judgment of the great whore' (v. 1), which is graphically detailed in her destruction by her former allies (v. 16). **Prophetic Exhortation & Warning** is significant (15.0%) because the entire passage is a prophetic discourse from an angel ('Come, I will show you,' 'I will tell you the mystery') that includes a direct call for discernment: 'This calls for a mind that has wisdom' (v. 9). **Lament, Persecution & Endurance** (10.0%) provides the moral justification for the judgment, centered on the image of the woman 'drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses to Jesus' (v. 6). A concentrated dose of **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope** (10.0%) appears in the pivotal assurance that 'the Lamb will conquer them' (v. 14). Minor scores are assigned to **Theophanic Awe & Terror** (2.5%) for John's amazement at the vision and **Worship & Praise** (2.5%) for the victorious title 'Lord of lords and King of kings.' The chapter is too theologically dense for any portion to be considered neutral.",
        "The analysis of this passage reveals a primary focus on Cosmic Warfare and Judicial Wrath. The dominant category is **Cosmic Warfare & Deception (35.0%)**, as the text is dedicated to unveiling the 'mystery' of 'Babylon the great' and the 'scarlet beast... full of blasphemous names.' This is evident in the imagery of the beast's heads and horns, its deceptive nature ('was, and is not'), and the explicit statement that its followers 'will make war on the Lamb.' Closely following is **Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action (30.0%)**, as the entire vision is framed by the angel's promise to show 'the judgment of the great whore.' This is graphically detailed in her fate: the beast and its allies 'will make her desolate and naked; they will devour her flesh and burn her up with fire.' **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope (15.0%)** provides the crucial theological counterpoint, concentrated in the powerful declaration that 'the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings.' The reality of suffering is acknowledged through **Lament, Persecution & Endurance (10.0%)**, primarily in the potent image of the woman being 'drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses to Jesus.'

        "The passage is overwhelmingly dominated by Worship & Praise, structured as a heavenly liturgy with repeated cries of 'Hallelujah!', a doxology ('Salvation and glory and power'), and explicit acts of worship ('fell down and worshiped'). This praise is explicitly grounded in Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action, celebrating that God 'has judged the great whore' and 'he has avenged on her the blood of his servants,' with the smoke rising 'forever and ever' as a sign of final punishment. A smaller but significant component is Prophetic Exhortation, found in the direct command from the throne to 'Praise our God.' The judgment itself functions as Victory & Consolation for the vindicated servants. The reference to the 'blood of his servants' acknowledges past persecution, but the passage's focus is on its resolution, not on lament.",
        "The passage is overwhelmingly dominated by two interwoven themes: heavenly worship and the divine judgment that prompts it. **Worship & Praise (55.0%)** is the primary rhetorical action, evidenced by the repeated cry of 'Hallelujah!', the doxology ('Salvation and glory and power to our God'), and the explicit prostration of the elders and living creatures who 'fell down and worshiped God.' **Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action (35.0%)** is the direct cause for this praise, articulated in the declaration that God's 'judgments are true and just' because 'he has judged the great whore' and 'avenged on her the blood of his servants.' The image of the smoke going up 'forever and ever' is a stark depiction of this punitive finality. **Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope (5.0%)** is present in the cry for 'Salvation' and the overall tone of vindication. **Prophetic Exhortation & Warning (2.5%)** is located in the direct command from the throne: 'Praise our God, all you his servants.' Finally, **Lament, Persecution & Endurance (2.5%)** is included as a minor but crucial background element, referencing the past martyrdom ('the blood of his servants') which is now the basis for divine vengeance and heavenly celebration.",

        "The passage is overwhelmingly dominated by Worship & Praise, structured as a heavenly liturgy with repeated cries of 'Hallelujah!', a doxology ('Salvation and glory and power'), and explicit acts of worship ('fell down and worshiped').

        "This passage depicts the triumphant climax of divine judgment. It opens with a powerful chorus of 'Worship & Praise' ('Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns,' v. 6), celebrating the 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' embodied in the 'marriage of the Lamb' (v. 7) and the beatitude for its guests (v. 9). This celebratory frame gives way to the execution of that victory, which is dominated by 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action.' This is the most prominent category, featuring the rider who will 'tread the wine press of the fury of the wrath of God' (v. 15), the 'lake of fire' (v. 20), and the grotesque 'supper of God' where birds are gorged on flesh (vv. 17-18, 21). The mechanism for this judgment is 'Cosmic Warfare & Deception,' as the armies of heaven confront the beast, the false prophet, and the kings of the earth (vv. 19-20). The vision of the rider on the white horse—with 'eyes are like a flame of fire' and the name 'The Word of God'—is a primary source of 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' (vv. 11-16). 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' appears in specific commands like 'Write this' and 'Worship God!' (vv. 9-10). 'Lament' is entirely absent, as the time for suffering has passed and the moment of vindication has arrived.",
        "This passage depicts the climactic turn from heavenly celebration to final judgment. The analysis reflects this two-part structure. 'Worship & Praise' is significant due to the opening 'Hallelujah!' chorus and the celebration of the 'marriage of the Lamb' (vv. 6-8). 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' is tied to this, celebrating the readiness of the bride and the ultimate triumph of the Lamb. However, the dominant category is 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' (35%), which constitutes the entire second half of the text. This is seen in the graphic descriptions of the rider who 'judges and makes war,' 'tread[s] the wine press of the fury of the wrath of God,' the grotesque 'great supper of God' where birds eat flesh, and the finality of the beast being 'thrown alive into the lake of fire' (vv. 11-21). 'Cosmic Warfare & Deception' is the narrative framework for this judgment, as the 'beast and the kings of the earth' gather for war (v. 19). 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is evoked by the fearsome appearance of the rider on the white horse ('eyes are like a flame of fire,' 'robe dipped in blood'). A small but distinct portion is assigned to 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' for the direct commands 'Write this' and 'Worship God!' (vv. 9-10).

Secondly, 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (30.0%) is equally strong, focusing on the reward for the faithful who 'came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years' in the 'first resurrection,' over whom 'the second death has no power.'

'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' is present in the divine commands ('See...', 'Write this') and the clear warning implicit in verse 8. 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' is evoked by the vision of the city descending from God, the 'loud voice from the throne,' and God's direct, self-identifying speech ('I am the Alpha and the Omega'). Finally, 'Lament, Persecution & Endurance' is present by its explicit resolution; the promises to end tears, death, and pain (v. 4) directly address the suffering that precedes this final state, and the reward is for those who 'conquer' (v. 7), implying a past struggle.",

        "The rhetorical profile of this passage is overwhelmingly dominated by 'Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope' (55.0%). The text opens with the climactic vision of a 'new heaven and a new earth' and the 'new Jerusalem' (v. 1-2). It is filled with promises of ultimate consolation: God will 'wipe every tear,' and 'death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more' (v. 4). The declaration 'I am making all things new' (v. 5) and the promise of inheritance for 'those who conquer' (v. 7) cement this as the primary theme. A significant secondary category is 'Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action' (20.0%), located entirely in the stark warning of verse 8, which lists various sinners and consigns them to 'the lake that burns with fire and sulfur.' 'Prophetic Exhortation & Warning' (15.0%) is also prominent, conveyed through commands like 'See' (vv. 3, 5) and 'Write this' (v. 5), which demand the audience's attention and belief. Finally, 'Theophanic Awe & Terror' (10.0%) is present in the majestic setting ('loud voice from the throne,' v. 3) and God's sovereign self-declaration as 'the Alpha and the Omega' (v. 6).

Theophanic Awe (5.0%) captures the non-terrifying awe inspired by the city's 'glory of God' and 'radiance.'

        "The overwhelming rhetorical focus of this passage is on Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope.

Worship & Praise is the second most prominent category, grounded in the text's direct statement that 'his servants will worship him' and the vision of unmediated communion ('they will see his face') before the 'throne of God and of the Lamb.' A small score is given to Theophanic Awe & Terror to capture the awe-inspiring nature of God's direct presence ('the Lord God will be their light'), though the element of terror is absent, replaced by intimacy.

        "The rhetorical profile of this concluding passage is dominated by Prophetic Exhortation & Warning and Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope. The primary function is to issue a final charge, built upon urgent commands ('Do not seal up the words,' v. 10), beatitudes ('Blessed is the one who keeps the words,' v. 7), invitations ('let everyone who is thirsty come,' v. 17), and a severe warning against altering the prophecy (v. 18-19). This is grounded in the repeated promise of Christ's imminent return ('See, I am coming soon,' v. 7, 12, 20) and the hope of reward, access to 'the tree of life' (v. 14), and the free gift of 'the water of life' (v. 17). Supporting these are significant elements of Judicial Wrath, which gives teeth to the warnings ('repay according to everyone's work,' v. 12; 'Outside are the dogs,' v. 15; 'God will add... the plagues,' v. 18), and Worship & Praise, which establishes divine authority through Christ's self-declarations ('I am the Alpha and the Omega,' v. 13) and the church's final response ('Come, Lord Jesus!', v. 20). A distinct moment of Theophanic Awe occurs when John falls to worship the angel (v. 8). The Other/Neutral category accounts for the crucial authenticating framework ('These words are trustworthy and true,' v. 6; 'I, John, am the one who heard and saw,' v. 8). Lament and Cosmic Warfare are absent as the focus is on the final state, not the preceding struggle.",
        "This passage, the epilogue of the Apocalypse, is dominated by Prophetic Exhortation & Warning and Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope. Prophetic Exhortation (35.0%) is evident in the beatitudes (v. 7, 14), direct commands ('Worship God!', v. 9; 'Do not seal up the words', v. 10), the open invitation to 'Come' (v. 17), and the severe warning against altering the book (v. 18-19). Victory & Hope (30.0%) is carried by the repeated promise 'I am coming soon' (v. 7, 12, 20) and the assurance of access to 'the tree of life' and 'the water of life' (v. 14, 17). Judicial Wrath (15.0%) is present in the consequences for altering the prophecy ('God will add to that person the plagues', v. 18) and the exclusion of the unrighteous from the city (v. 15). Worship & Praise (15.0%) is found in the command to 'Worship God!' (v. 9), the high Christological titles ('Alpha and Omega', v. 13), and the final prayer, 'Come, Lord Jesus!' (v. 20).

        "The rhetorical profile of this concluding passage is dominated by Prophetic Exhortation & Warning, which constitutes its primary function. This is evident in the direct commands ('Do not seal up the words,' v. 10), beatitudes ('Blessed is the one who keeps the words,' v. 7), invitations ('let everyone who is thirsty come,' v. 17), and the explicit, severe warning against altering the book (v. 18-19). A close second is Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope, which provides the positive motivation through the repeated promise 'I am coming soon' (v. 7, 12, 20), the reward of the 'tree of life' (v. 14), and the free gift of the 'water of life' (v. 17). Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action serves as the negative counterpart, seen in the repayment for works (v. 12), the exclusion of sinners from the city (v. 15), and the specific curses for tampering with the text (v. 18-19). Worship & Praise is also significant, present in the command to 'Worship God!' (v. 9), Jesus's divine self-identification ('I am the Alpha and the Omega,' v. 13), and the final acclamation, 'Come, Lord Jesus!' (v. 20). Minor scores are assigned to Theophanic Awe for John's falling before the angel (v. 8), and to Lament/Endurance and Cosmic Warfare for faint allusions to the difficulty of faithfulness and the practice of 'falsehood' (v. 11, 15).",

Prophetic Exhortation (35.0%) is evident in the beatitudes (v. 7, 14), direct commands ('Worship God!', v. 9; 'Do not seal up the words', v. 10), the open invitation to 'Come' (v. 17), and the severe warning against altering the book (v. 18-19). Victory & Hope (30.0%) is carried by the repeated promise 'I am coming soon' (v. 7, 12, 20) and the assurance of access to 'the tree of life' and 'the water of life' (v. 14, 17). Judicial Wrath (15.0%) is present in the consequences for altering the prophecy ('God will add to that person the plagues', v. 18) and the exclusion of the unrighteous from the city (v. 15). Worship & Praise (15.0%) is found in the command to 'Worship God!' (v. 9), the high Christological titles ('Alpha and Omega', v. 13), and the final prayer, 'Come, Lord Jesus!' (v. 20). A small but distinct element of Theophanic Awe (5.0%) appears in John's impulse to fall down and worship the angel (v. 8). The remaining categories are not present in this concluding section.",
        "The rhetorical profile of this concluding passage is dominated by Prophetic Exhortation & Warning, which constitutes its primary function. This is evident in the direct commands ('Do not seal up the words,' v. 10), beatitudes ('Blessed is the one who keeps the words,' v. 7), invitations ('let everyone who is thirsty come,' v. 17), and the explicit, severe warning against altering the book (v. 18-19). A close second is Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope, which provides the positive motivation through the repeated promise 'I am coming soon' (v. 7, 12, 20), the reward of the 'tree of life' (v. 14), and the free gift of the 'water of life' (v. 17). Judicial Wrath & Punitive Action serves as the negative counterpart, seen in the repayment for works (v. 12), the exclusion of sinners from the city (v. 15), and the specific curses for tampering with the text (v. 18-19). Worship & Praise is also significant, present in the command to 'Worship God!' (v. 9), Jesus's divine self-identification ('I am the Alpha and the Omega,' v. 13), and the final acclamation, 'Come, Lord Jesus!' (v. 20). Minor scores are assigned to Theophanic Awe for John's falling before the angel (v. 8), and to Lament/Endurance and Cosmic Warfare for faint allusions to the difficulty of faithfulness and the practice of 'falsehood' (v. 11, 15).",

        "The rhetorical profile of this concluding passage is dominated by Prophetic Exhortation & Warning and Victory, Consolation & New-Creation Hope. The primary function is to issue a final charge, built upon urgent commands ('Do not seal up the words,' v. 10), beatitudes ('Blessed is the one who keeps the words,' v. 7), invitations ('let everyone who is thirsty come,' v. 17), and a severe warning against altering the prophecy (v. 18-19). This is grounded in the repeated promise of Christ's imminent return ('See, I am coming soon,' v. 7, 12, 20) and the hope of reward, access to 'the tree of life' (v. 14), and the free gift of 'the water of life' (v. 17). Supporting these are significant elements of Judicial Wrath, which gives teeth to the warnings ('repay according to everyone's work,' v. 12; 'Outside are the dogs,' v. 15; 'God will add... the plagues,' v. 18), and Worship & Praise, which establishes divine authority through Christ's self-declarations ('I am the Alpha and the Omega,' v. 13) and the church's final response ('Come, Lord Jesus!', v. 20). A distinct moment of Theophanic Awe occurs when John falls to worship the angel (v. 8). The Other/Neutral category accounts for the crucial authenticating framework ('These words are trustworthy and true,' v. 6; 'I, John, am the one who heard and saw,' v. 8). Lament and Cosmic Warfare are absent as the focus is on the final state, not the preceding struggle."
